Want efficiently stored file names

Cant use const char* becuse cannot store pointers.

Can use fixed length, but then losing the ability to efficiently store file 
names.

If going to lame out and loose a couple points, can use const char[64]. Do not 
go smaller. nothing will break with 64.

touch shoud be able to set time to custom value and current time

would be present time if no additional flags to touch command.

the read and write api has this interesting propery the offset is the byte 
position into your file.

ex. open file. cursor is at 0. write 10 bytes. next call will be at 10 bytes.



The sylabus says the midnight deadline is hard. However, 1% per hour will be 
taken until 10PM tomorrow night.

Never return an autograde result after like 6PM tonight on Bottlenose.

- Fix bmap
- Change const char* -> text file
